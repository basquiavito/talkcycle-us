   "nutgraph0":{"preLink":"Gustar is a verb that means —to like. However, it's used differently than the English verb 'like'. In Spanish, gustar is often used with an indirect object pronoun (me, te, le, nos, les) to indicate who the liking is directed towards. For example, instead of saying 'I like chocolate,' you would say 'Me gusta el chocolate,' which literally translates to 'The chocolate pleases me.'",

   "nutgraph1":{"preLink":"When it comes to using gustar, it's important to remember that the subject of the sentence is actually the thing or activity being liked, not the person doing the liking. This means that the verb needs to agree with the thing or activity being liked, not the person doing the liking. For example, if you wanted to say 'I like apples,' you would say 'Me gustan las manzanas,' with the verb gustar agreeing with the plural noun manzanas (apples). On the other hand, if you wanted to say 'He likes to dance,' you would say 'Le gusta bailar,' with the verb gustar agreeing with the singular noun bailar (dance). ",

This means that the verb form changes depending on whether the object is singular or plural. Additionally, the indirect object pronoun used must agree with the subject in gender and number." ,

   "nutgraph3":{"preLink":"Another key aspect of gustar's grammar is its word order. In Spanish, the object being liked comes before the verb gustar, and the indirect object pronoun follows the verb. For example, 'Me gusta el café' translates to 'I like coffee,' with 'el café' being the object being liked, 'gusta' being the third person singular conjugation of gustar, and 'me' being the indirect object pronoun indicating who the liking is directed towards. Understanding this word order is crucial in correctly using gustar in Spanish sentences.",
